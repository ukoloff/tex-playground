About some types of constraints in problems of routing}

Many routing problems arising in different applications,
can be interpreted as a discrete optimization problem with additional restrictions.
The latter include generalized travelling salesman problem (GTSP),
to which task of tool routing for thermal cutting sheet CNC machines
is sometimes reduced.
