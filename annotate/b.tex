About some types of constraints in routing problems}

Many routing problems arising in different applications,
can be interpreted as a discrete optimization problem with additional restrictions.
The latter include generalized travelling salesman problem (GTSP),
to which task of tool routing for thermal cutting sheet CNC machines
is sometimes reduced.
Technological requirements bound to thermal fields distribution
during cutting process are of great importance
when developing algorithms for this task solution.
These requirements give rise to some specific restrictions for GTSP.
The report provides a mathematical formulation
for the problem of thermal fields calculating
during metal sheet thermal cutting.
Corresponding algorithm with its programmatic implementation is considered.
The mathematical model allowing to take such restrictions into account
considering other routing problems is discussed either.
