About one algorithm of the broken line approximation and a modelling of tool path
for CNC plate cutting machines}

The problem of approximating two-dimensional poly-line
with composite curve consisting of arc and line segments
is considered.
The resulting curve nodes have to coincide with source poly-line nodes.
This problem arises in the development of control programs
for CNC (computer numerical control) cutting machines,
permitting a circular interpolation.
An original algorithm is proposed
minimizing the number of nodes for resulting composite curve.
The algorithm is implemented in the environment of the russian CAD system 
T-Flex CAD using its API (Application Program Interface).
The algorithm optimality is investigated.
The result of test calculation along with its geometrical visualization is given.
